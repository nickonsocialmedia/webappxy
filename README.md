üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Well Hello There Fellow Traveler! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

This is a basic Flask Project for test purposes so dont get to excited,
It has a maze of links for practicing web crawling and can be run locally easilly using:

- need to download activate venv.
  
- (cd into webappxy)

- run:
        python app.py 
 
and you can view this app on 127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser. 

running it on aws is a bit more complicated but thats what ive done here:
